# NoteFlow – PRD (Fake)

Problem:
Students take scattered notes across apps but can't find or organize them for studying.

Solution:
NoteFlow automatically organizes notes into study guides by:
- Detecting topics, timestamps, and question patterns
- Creating searchable flashcards from definitions/examples
- Generating exam-style summaries and timelines

Key features:
- Multi-app import (Notion, Google Docs, handwritten scans)
- Auto-generated mind maps and timelines
- "Study mode" that prioritizes weak areas
- Shareable study guides for group study

Success metrics:
- 40% reduction in study prep time vs manual organization
- 85% of notes tagged automatically on first import
- 3.5+ star average study guide quality rating
