# Multi-Agent Marketing Brief Automator

A **4-agent LLM workflow** to turn short product descriptions into structured, high-quality marketing briefs in **one click**. Built with **Python + Streamlit** and leveraging **Groq's openai/gpt-oss-120B** model.

## 🚀 Features

- Automated multi-agent workflow:
  - **Researcher**: extracts insights from product description
  - **Strategist**: creates marketing strategy
  - **Writer**: drafts the brief
  - **Reviewer**: validates draft and triggers iterative refinement if needed
- Pre-agent LLM infers **target audience and metadata** automatically
- Token-efficient prompts: each agent sees **only minimal context**
- Rate-limit handling and retries using **Groq Python SDK**
- Browser-friendly **Streamlit UI** for one-click execution
- Secure API key management via **environment variables** or Streamlit secrets

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input:** A short product description.
2. **Pre-agent LLM:** Enriches the product specification to support efficient search and retrieval within the workflow.
3. **Agent workflow:**  
   - Researcher → Strategist → Writer → Reviewer  
   - Optional reviewer loop for iterative refinement
4. **Output:** Structured, multi-section marketing brief ready for review and search indexing.

**Prompt context per agent:**
| Agent      | Context Provided              |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| Researcher | Product + Summary             |
| Strategist | Product + Research            |
| Writer     | Product + Strategy            |
| Reviewer   | Product + Draft               |
